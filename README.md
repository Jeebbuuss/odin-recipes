Project: Recipes for the Foundations Course

I am in process of completing the Odin Project Foundations Course.  I have practiced working with the Terminal, VS Code and some HTML.  When complete, this project will have a main page (index.html) and links to recipes.  It will not be as polished for now until we cover CSS later.
