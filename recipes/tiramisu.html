        <h2>Equipment</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Double Boiler</li>
            <li>Wire Whisk</li>
            <li>9 x 9 inch Pan</li>
            <li>Electric Mxer</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>6 large egg yolks</li>
            <li>1 cup sugar (superfine or caster if possible)</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cups mascarpone cheese (at room temperature)</li>
            <li>1 3/4 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
            <li>30 each Italian ladyfingers (about 1 1/2 to 2 packages[Savoiadi style])</li>
            <li>1 cup cold espresso or strong coffee</li>
            <li>1/2 cup coffee flavored liqueur (optional)</li>
            <li>1 oz unsweetened cocoa for dusting</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <h2>Directions</h2>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>
                   <strong>This is how you make the Sabayon</strong> - When you are ready to make the sabayon place about one inch of water in a small pot and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to simmer and place a bowl on top of the small pot so it's sitting on the pot without touching the water.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Add the egg yolks and sugar to the bowl, whipping to mix the ingredients together. Place the bowl on the small pot of simmering water. Using a whisk to mix, whip the egg/sugar mixture constantly for about 10 minutes. This will cook the eggs. The mixture will increase in volume as it thickens. This is your sabayon. After you have finished whipping the sabayon, remove the bowl from the heat and continue to whip yolks to help it cool. The mixture should be thick and a lemon yellow color. Allow to cool briefly before mixing in mascarpone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>**If the bowl starts to get too hot, lift the bowl of the pot of water for 15 seconds or so while continuing to whip the mixture.  You can do this as often as necessary.</em>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Add room tempreature Mascarpone to whipped yolks.  Mix until well comvbined.  Don't overmix as this can cause curdling.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>*Mascarpone only nees to get set out for 15-20 minutes.  Don't let it get too warm.</em>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    In a separate bowl, using an electric mixer, whip cream to stiff peaks (hand or stand mixers are fine).  This process should be slow, starting on lowand increasing in speed over about 10 minutes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>**This method is how you keep the whipped cream from breaking.  The cream should be ice cold and as fresh as possible.  Look for heavy cream with the longest expiration date.</em>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Gently fold the whipped cream in the mascarpone sabayon mixture and refrigerate until you are ready to assemble the tiramisu.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Mix the cold espresso (or strong coffee) with the coffee liqueur and dip the ladyfingers in the mixture just long enough to get them wet.  <strong>Do not soak them!</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>**If you can't use alcohol, just leave out the liqueur.</em>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Arrange the ladyfingers in the bottom of a 9 x 9 inch square baking dish (or similarly sized container).
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Spoon half the mascarpone cream filling over the ladyfingers.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Repeat the process with another layer of ladyfingers.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Add another layer of tiramisu cream.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Refrigerate at least 4 hours.  Overnight is best.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Dust with cocoa right before serving.
